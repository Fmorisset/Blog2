<b>What is the difference between African Tribes & Ethnicites?</b><br />

My research was intensive as it included research of each African country, in which I had to find pertinent information and images to reresent one African country. During my research I found that there were thousands of tribes and ethnicities accounting for over billion people in Africa. Please find the difference between ethnicities and tribes. Enjoy the beautiful pictures below of the various African tribes and ethnicities.

<b>Tribe</b><br />
“Tribe” refers – should properly refer – to a ethnic sub-set within which all or most human activities are organized on the basis of kinship. Tribal peoples interact with each other primarily in term of family relationships, both by descent and by marriage. <br />

<b>Ethnicities</b><br />
Ethnic groups in Africa number in the thousands, each generally having its own language (or dialect of a language) and culture. The largest ethnic groups mostly originate from major historic political kingdoms, such as in West Africa with the Sahelian kingdoms of the medieval period, like that of the Akan, deriving from Bonoman (11th century) then the Kingdom of Ashanti (17th century) and in Central Africa with the Kanuri of the Kanem and Bornu Empires.

Enjoy interesting pictures from various tribes and ethnicites in Africa.
