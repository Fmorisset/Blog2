<b>The Overall Creative Process</b><br />

The Overall Creative Process happened is several steps of re-iteration and design thinking.< b/>

The "process" is cyclical and I find myself revisiting various steps. While the "process" is very individualized in order and which steps you choose to implement, it all incorporates the core designer and designing thinking elements.< b/>

<b>Steps<b>< b/>
1. Brainstormed themes and ideas for my project: I came up with 3 ideas that I pitched to the class.
2. Researched and explored my inspirations as well as new technologies ideas to execute my project.
3. Ideate - Diverge from my original thoughts and concepts
4. Defined the scope of the project and synthesized my idea to one project.
5. Prototype my idea and tested various 2-d and 3-d models to execute my project.
6. Choose the final project and execution medium for the project.
7. Implemented the idea and created the project.
8. Refined and perfected the project.
