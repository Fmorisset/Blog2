<b>The Overall Creative Process</b><br />

The Overall Creative Process happened is several steps of re-iteration and design thinking.< b/>

The "process" is cyclical and I find myself revisiting various steps. While the "process" is very individualized in order and which steps you choose to implement, it all incorporates the core designer and designing thinking elements.<br />

<b>STEPS</b><br />
<b>1. Brainstormed themes and ideas for my project. </b><br />
        I came up with 3 ideas that I pitched to the class. 
        Idea 1 – Prototype a gallery space model for upcoming exhibit. <br />
        Idea 2 – Map art from various countries on a map creating a data visual story. <br />
        Idea 3 – Designer Application that projects and holograms art into space in your home or office.<br />
<b>2. Researched and explored my inspirations as well as new technologies ideas to execute my project.</b><br />
        
<b>3. Ideate - Diverge from my original thoughts and concepts. </b><br />
<b>4. Defined the scope of the project and synthesized my idea to one project. </b><br />
<b>5. Prototype my idea and tested various 2-d and 3-d models to execute my project. </b><br />
        While prototyping my idea, I realized that it would be too difficult to utilized images and decided to switch to     textiles and cross reference it with the different tribes in each country. It was a huge break-through in which I would not have decided if I did not prototype the idea several times.<br />
<b>6. Choose the final project and execution medium for the project. </b><br />

<b>7. Implemented the idea and created the project. </b><br />
        
<b>8. Refined and perfected the project.</b><br />
        This will be a continous process.
