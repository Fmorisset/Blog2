The Overall Creative Process happened is several steps of re-iteration and design thinking.< b/>

The "process" is cyclical and I find myself revisiting various steps. While the "process" is very individualized in order and which steps you choose to implement, it all incorporates the core designer and designing thinking elements.<br />

<b>STEPS</b><br />
<b>1. Brainstormed themes and ideas for my final project. </b><br />
I came up with several ideas and thoughts for my Visualization and Prototyping class.

<b>2. Researched and explored my inspirations as well as new technologies ideas to execute my project.</b><br /> 
I came up with 3 ideas that I pitched to the class. I received feedback and moved onto Step 3 to help me narrow down and select one project. <br />
        Idea 1 – Prototype a gallery space model for upcoming exhibit. <br />
        Idea 2 – Map art from various countries on a map creating a data visual story. <br />
        Idea 3 – Designer Application that projects and holograms art into space in your home or office.<br />
        
<b>3. Defined the scope of the project and synthesized my idea to one project. </b><br />
        I completed an in-depth process where I used 5 "W's" to define the project as well as  used a "Mind Map" visualize the project. These steps help guide the process and develop information for my idea. I settled on the idea of "Mapping Art Across the World." I wanted to use the art from my art gallery to show the origins of the various pieces as an entree to novice art collectors.<br />

<b>4. Prototype my idea and tested various 2-d and 3-d models to execute my project. </b><br />
        While prototyping my idea, I diverge from my original concepts because I realized that it would be too difficult to execute and manage all the data with the time constraints and my limited technology background. I moved onto step 5 to figure out exactly what my final project was going to be.
        
<b>5. Choose the final project and execution medium for the project. </b><br />
Instead of utilizing artwork, I decided to switch to textiles and limit my project to just Africa. My plan was now to crossed reference the country with their respect tribal textile that was from that region. It was a huge break-through in which I would not have decided if I did not prototype the idea several times.<br />

<b>6. Implemented the idea and created the project. </b><br />
I used wiki-pedia and google to find all my data and images. I finalized the process with Mapbox and Photoshop.
        
<b>7. Refined and perfected the project.</b><br />
        This will be a continuous process as I come up with ideas to make the project interactive. <br />
