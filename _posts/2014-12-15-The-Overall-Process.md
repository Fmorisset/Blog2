<b>The Overall Creative Process</b><br />

The Overall Creative Process happened is several steps of re-iteration and design thinking.< b/>

The "process" is cyclical and I find myself revisiting various steps. While the "process" is very individualized in order and which steps you choose to implement, it all incorporates the core designer and designing thinking elements.< b/>

<b>Steps<b>< b/>
<b>1. Brainstormed themes and ideas for my project. <b>< b/> 
        I came up with 3 ideas that I pitched to the class.
<b>2. Researched and explored my inspirations as well as new technologies ideas to execute my project.<b>< b/>
<b>3. Ideate - Diverge from my original thoughts and concepts. <b>< b/>
<b>4. Defined the scope of the project and synthesized my idea to one project. <b>< b/>
<b>5. Prototype my idea and tested various 2-d and 3-d models to execute my project. <b>< b/>
        While prototyping my idea, I realized that it would be too difficult to utilized images and decided to switch to     textiles and cross reference it with the different tribes in each country. It was a huge break-through in which I would not have decided if I did not prototype the idea several times.
<b>6. Choose the final project and execution medium for the project. <b>< b/>

<b>7. Implemented the idea and created the project. <b>< b/>
        
<b>8. Refined and perfected the project.<b>< b/>
        This will be a continous process.
