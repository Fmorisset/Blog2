Vivant uses Github to Document and Prototype

What is Github? An open source codes? Databases storage? Revision management database? Yes to all. Check out the full definition here https://github.com/about

Join me for the next 5 weeks as we explore Visualization and Prototyping. I will explore Visualization of Prototyping with art and technology in mind. My goal is to create some very cool that I can use or further develop.
